## Welcome
I'm a full stack developer. I work primarily in the JavaScript and Python ecosystems. Take a look around, and send me an email if you have any questions.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @calebthewood
- ðŸ‘€ Check out my relaunched [personal site v2](https://www.calebwood.dev/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on putting an AI bot in my twitter clone
  - Update, this led to building a comments system which led to #7DaysOfCanva so I can step-up my design skills and give the site a facelift.
