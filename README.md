## Welcome
I'm a fullstack developer. I especially enjoy JavaScript, but I'll work with whatever tool is best for the job. Take a look around, and send me an email if you have any questions. P.S. I am currently seeking fulltime employment as a fullstack or frontend dev, so snap me up before someone else does!
