## Welcome
I'm a full stack developer. I work primarily in the JavaScript (Node, Express, React) and Python (Flask) ecosystems. 

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @calebthewood
- ðŸ‘€ Check out my relaunched [personal site](https://www.calebwood.dev/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on putting an AI bot in my twitter clone
  - Update: this led to building a comments system which led to #7DaysOfCanva so b/c I want to move the project off Bootstrap. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...calebwood.cs@gmail.com
